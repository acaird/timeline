# Timelines

Wikipedia has cool timelines for organizations, like bands. For an example, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division#Timeline

The format for this is defined in the specification described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:EasyTimeline_syntax

The code here cannot parse everything as defined in the specification, but it can parse enough to get something useful from files of this type.

# Examples

The data files in `/examples` are copied directly from Wikipedia. The graphics are generated by the code here.

![Timeline for The Cure](./examples/the_cure.png "Timeline for The Cure")

![Timeline for Franz Ferdinand](./examples/franz_ferdinand.png "Timeline for Franz Ferdinand")

![Timeline for Joy Division](./examples/joy_division.png "Timeline for Joy Division")

![Timeline for R.E.M.](./examples/rem.png "Timeline for R.E.M.")

1. Run the program with the command
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go /path/to/data/file
   ```
1. To see the options, run:
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go --help
   ```
   for example, you can produce `the_cure.png` (as shown above) with the command:
